TODO:
	Better doc generation method + better XML + DTD (Schema)
	
	Tasks don't seem to update output often enough
	
	Break scripts into their own project, make simple e93 rc files for release
	
	Still have stange event problems, either due to Tcl interaction or wgui/events.c
	Command keys coming through as chars, track this down.
	
	shell.c SetUpTclAbortHandling works on Windows, check on X
	
	HOTKEY as Ctrl-Break doesn't work, because Windows generates a VK_CANCEL
	when it see that key combo, apparently before it checks for HOTKEY.
	I'm now using VK_ESCAPE unmodified as UNIX does
	
	Tcl/Tk events
	
	Fix the backspace text motion commands
	"Option" key, use the WinKey? (not working)
	
	Make sure bindkey works as advertized
	
	make open dialog file filter settable from rc files

	Get rid of MDI

	Better file icons

	Support \\F change font in menus in addmenu
		
	JBuilder style text completion
	
	add popup menu over the cursor support on both versions
	
	Boundkeys command
	
	Menus command
		
	user home solution
	
Stuff for X:

	X windows position windows bug

	dim inactive menus on X

Open questions:
	
	the SCRIPTPATH var should go away in favor of tcl_rcFileName

	I think task should die by default unless explicitly detached from the buffer
	New command detatch task (like bg)

	Should bad keynames be ignored on X? (They are not in Windows)

	I rather like the bindkey/addmenu blend in Windows. Should this concept move to X?

	exit:
		should it be deleted, or just no-op'ed?

	Can we remove the the programName string in
		e93.c
		globals.c
		shellcmd.c
			same as "info nameofexecutable"

	fromfile:
		same as "file exists"

	insert:
		could be same as puts if each buffer had its own channel

	add an optional arg to task (completion proc)
		task bufferName taskData ?completionProc?

	What dialog commands can be removed since Tk provides them?
	
	Use Tclsh?
