<SUMMARY>
Changing your mind
</SUMMARY>

<BODY>

<P>e93 remembers undo/redo information only for operations that change the text of a buffer. It does not remember cursor movements, or selections.</P>

<P>Unlimited amounts of undo information are recorded separately for each buffer. e93 groups character insertions and deletions so that they become single undo items.</P>

<P>Each time you undo in a buffer, e93 remembers what was undone as redo information. However, once you make a change in a buffer, all redo information is lost.</P>
