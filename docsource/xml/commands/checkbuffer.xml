</SUMMARY>
   <DESCRIPTION>
Run a sanity check on <VAR>bufferName</VAR>. If there is no problem (which there never should be unless there is a bug in e93),
report some statistics about bufferName in a dialog box.
If there is a problem, e93 may CRASH, or if you are lucky, it will tell you what is wrong.
This should NEVER report any problems. If it does, please let me know! <A href="mailto:squirest@e93.org">squirest@e93.org</A>
