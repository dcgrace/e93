<SUMMARY>
Newline character issues on MS Windows
</SUMMARY>

<BODY>

<P>The MS-DOS/Windows environment uses both a carriage return (CR) and a line feed (LF) to denote a newline.
Internally, the editor uses just LF, and as such, will strip any CRs it sees that are followed by LFs in its input.
Likewise, any text that the editor is exporting to the system will have CRs added to the LFs.
This  process is not guaranteed to leave binary files intact, so care should be taken when editing them.
File translation can be turned on or off by setting the <CODE>filetranslationmode</CODE> Tcl boolean variable.</P>
