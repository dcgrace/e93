<BODY>
<P>e93 is a portable window based text editor oriented to the needs of
programmers. It was written to take advantage of the windowing systems
found on today's workstations, and high-end PCs. e93 is based on the
Tcl scripting language, and relys on this language for most of its
high level functionality.
</P>
<P>e93 supports a model of editing which emphasizes limiting the number
of modes, and maximizing the use of a small, easily learned set of
editing commands.

<B>NOTE:</B> Since e93 is portable, I have attempted to keep this manual
machine/OS independent to a reasonable extent. However, since e93 was
first written for UN*X machines, there is a slight bias towards them
in this documentation.
