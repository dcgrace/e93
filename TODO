TODO:

Add options to many commands to allow them to work in marks

Add menus to 'expand', 'unexpand', and 'fmt' text

Tk
{
	Replace most dialogs with Tk equivalents.

	Add directory changing/saving with the open file dialog

	> If I remember correctly, the save dialog on OPENSTEP would leave the text box alone

Fix prototype recognition for:

void QuantizeFrame(Frame *pFrame,mbInfo *pInfo,INT16 (*pBlocks)[64],int yStart,int yEnd)
{
}

void UnQuantizeFrame(mbInfo *pInfo,INT16 (*pBlocks)[64],const UINT8 *pIntraQ, const UINT8 *pNonIntraQ,int yStart,int yEnd)
{
if(this==4)
{
}
}

int
aa(int test,			// this is a test
	char blah
	) {		/* this is a test */
}
